# Usage

Yeah so i'll write this when I finish the app.  
But like rn there's a menu button on the top right to change the OBS address, and another to change the button assignments.

**Keys**

* <kbd>1</kbd>-<kbd>9</kbd> - Select preview scene
* <kbd>SPACE</kbd> - Fade transition
* <kbd>ENTER</kbd> - Cut transition
